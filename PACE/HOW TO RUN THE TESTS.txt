rand.py is the file which essentially does whack a mole with blocks popping up on the screen

opto2560.py is the optokinetic tape test scaled for this display

optoTest.py is me testing making the red regions bigger to possibly aide in camera inaccuracy but will not track block location properly

right click in the folder and select "git BASH here"

in the terminal window type:

"python opto2560.py"
